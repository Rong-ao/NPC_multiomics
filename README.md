# NPC_multiomics
This resporitory contains bioinformatics analysis scripts for cell-cycle-related neural progenitor cell differentiation omics data, including __RNA-seq__, __ATAC-seq__ and __single-cell RNA-seq__ data.
Citation is still unpublished. 
__Thanks [@silentFUSU](https://github.com/silentFUSU) for creating parts of scripts and contribution to the project.__
## RNA-seq analysis

## ATAC-seq analysis

## single-cell RNA-seq analysis
Single-cell RNA-seq in this project was generated with a scMulti-omics sequencing from 10X Gemonics. Only Rawdata of Single-cell RNA-seq was processed with CellRanger-arc
